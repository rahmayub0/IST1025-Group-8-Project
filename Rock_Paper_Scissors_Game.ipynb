    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project implements a fun version of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python. The game allows the user to play multiple rounds against the computer, with a scoreboard to track wins, losses, and ties. It also includes humorous messages, a dramatic countdown, and a hidden cheat code to enhance engagement.\n"

    "This version of Rock-Paper-Scissors adds a humorous twist and score tracking to make the game more engaging. It shows how simple logic, a loop, and a few strings can create an interactive user experience.\n",

    "### Future Improvements\n",
    "- Create a GUI with `tkinter`\n",
    "- Add multiplayer support\n"
